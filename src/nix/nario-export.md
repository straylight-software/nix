R""(

# Examples

* Export the closure of the build of `nixpkgs#hello`:

  ```console
  # nix nario export --format 2 -r nixpkgs#hello > dump.nario
  ```

  It can be imported into another store:

  ```console
  # nix nario import --no-check-sigs < dump.nario
  ```

# Description

This command prints to standard output a serialization of the specified store paths in `nario` format. This serialization can be imported into another store using `nix nario import`.

References of a path are not exported by default; use `-r` to export a complete closure.
Paths are exported in topologically sorted order (i.e. if path `X` refers to `Y`, then `Y` appears before `X`).
You must specify the desired `nario` version. Currently the following versions are supported:

* `1`: This version is compatible with the legacy `nix-store --export` and `nix-store --import` commands. It should be avoided because it is not memory-efficient on import. It does not support signatures, so you have to use `--no-check-sigs` on import.

* `2`: The latest version. Recommended.
