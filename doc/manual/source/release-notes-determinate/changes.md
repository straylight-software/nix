# Changes between Nix and Determinate Nix

This section lists the differences between upstream Nix 2.33 and Determinate Nix 3.15.1.<!-- differences -->

* In Determinate Nix, flakes are stable. You no longer need to enable the `flakes` experimental feature.

* In Determinate Nix, the new Nix CLI (i.e. the `nix` command) is stable. You no longer need to enable the `nix-command` experimental feature.

* Determinate Nix has a setting [`json-log-path`](@docroot@/command-ref/conf-file.md#conf-json-log-path) to send a copy of all Nix log messages (in JSON format) to a file or Unix domain socket.

* Determinate Nix has made `nix profile install` an alias to `nix profile add`, a more symmetrical antonym of `nix profile remove`.

* `nix-channel` and `channel:` url syntax (like `channel:nixos-24.11`) is deprecated, see: https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-src/issues/34

* Using indirect flake references and implicit inputs is deprecated, see: https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-src/issues/37

* Warnings around "dirty trees" are updated to reduce "dirty" jargon, and now refers to "uncommitted changes".

<!-- Determinate Nix version 3.11.3 -->


<!-- Determinate Nix version 3.12.0 -->

* A new command `nix nario` that replaces `nix-store --export|--export`. It also has a new file format (`--format 2`) that supports store path attributes such as signatures, and that can be imported more efficiently. [DeterminateSystems/nix-src#215](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-src/pull/215)

<!-- Determinate Nix version 3.13.1 -->


<!-- Determinate Nix version 3.13.2 -->

* The Git fetcher doesn't compute `revCount` or `lastModified` if they're already specified [DeterminateSystems./nix-src#269](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-src/pull/269)

* The Git fetcher avoids doing a shallow Git fetch if it previously did a non-shallow fetch of the same repository. [DeterminateSystems/nix-src#270](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-src/pull/270)

* Determinate Nix has a builtin copy of the flake registry, making it more resilient to network outages. [DeterminateSystems/nix-src#271](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-src/pull/271)

<!-- Determinate Nix version 3.14.0 -->

* `nix build` and `nix profile` report failing or succeeding installables. [DeterminateSystems/nix-src#281](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-src/pull/281)

* Determinate Nix has a builtin function `builtins.filterAttrs`. [DeterminateSystems/nix-src#291](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-src/pull/291)

<!-- Determinate Nix version 3.15.1 -->

* Bring back the free alpha by @grahamc in [DeterminateSystems/nix-src#305](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-src/pull/305)
