# Release 3.15.1 (2025-12-24)

* Based on [upstream Nix 2.33.0](../release-notes/rl-2.33.md).

## What's Changed
Users reported the v3.15.0 tarball could not be fetched in a fixed-output derivation due to current stdenv paths present in the documentation. This release eliminated those paths.

Additionally, this change re-enables CodeRabbit's code review on our changes. CodeRabit was disabled by the upstream project, and we inadvertently included that change.
