# Release 3.13.0 (2025-11-09)

* Based on [upstream Nix 2.32.3](../release-notes/rl-2.32.md).

## What's Changed


### Git sources have a progress indicator again

Nix used to feel "stuck" while it was cloning large repositories.
Determinate Nix now shows git's native progress indicator while fetching.

### C API improvements

We've invested in the C API to support our work on closure analysis for SBOM generation, and made a couple of changes:

* C API: add nix_locked_flake_read_path for flake file reading
* C API: make nix_store_get_fs_closure compatible with upstream

PRs:
* [DeterminateSystems/nix-src#244](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-src/pull/244)
* [DeterminateSystems/nix-src#254](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-src/pull/254)

### Dropping support for Intel Macs

Determinate Nix no longer supports being installed on Intel Macs.
Determinate Nix will continue to support building for Intel macOS targets, but only from an Apple Silicon host.

From our intent-to-ship:
> Over the past year, we’ve watched usage of Determinate on Intel macOS hosts dwindle to a minuscule fraction of total usage.
> It currently stands at approximately 0.02% of all installations.
> The vast majority are run in managed CI environments that, we anticipate, will be able to easily convert to using Apple Silicon runners.
